Attempting to simulate projectile motion without air resistance in python, using matplotlib, numpy and math libraries.
Finds key values that the projectile reaches (e.g. time to impact, maximum height, horizontal distance)

Small project to practice my skills with general python libraries and customtkinter for GUI support.
